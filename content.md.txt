Business recovery support when it matters most

Section 1: What we do

Fourseen helps businesses recover quickly and strategically after major incidents, losses, or disruption. We work alongside directors and stakeholders to minimise operational impact and protect gross profit.

We can help with:

Incident and disruption response planning

Claims strategy and recovery support

Stakeholder management during high-pressure events

Investigation support: what happened, why, and who pays

Practical recovery planning to regain momentum

Section 2: Why it matters

In the aftermath of an incident, competing demands come fast — insurers, loss adjusters, banks, landlords, authorities, lawyers, compliance, staff, and family. Clarity and speed matter.

Our role is to:

Help you take control of the response

Prioritise actions that accelerate recovery

Reduce downtime and financial impact

Support you through complex stakeholder pressure

Section 3: Funding and liability

Insurance is one source of recovery funding — often not the only one. Correct investigation and documentation can identify additional routes, responsibilities, and liabilities.

We focus on:

Recovery strategy aligned to your business goals

Evidence and documentation that supports your position

A practical path forward, not just theory

What we do

Section 1: Recovery advisory and support

We provide hands-on advice and assistance to help businesses recover in the fastest time possible, considering the real-world constraints you face.

Support includes:

Rapid assessment and prioritisation

Recovery planning and coordination

Practical decision support for directors

Communications support across stakeholders

Section 2: Claims and financial recovery

Our background is founded in insurance claims, but our work extends beyond claims alone. The aim is to minimise the impact of an incident on gross profit and accelerate the return to normal operations.

We help you:

Build a clear recovery narrative and evidence pack

Navigate insurer and loss adjuster processes

Improve the quality and speed of claim progression

Identify what costs may be recoverable

Section 3: Investigation, liabilities, and “who pays”

After an incident, the question is not only “what happened?” but also “who is responsible?” Getting this right can materially change the recovery outcome.

We support:

Initial investigation and fact-finding

Liability considerations and documentation

Coordination with legal and specialist parties where needed

APPROACH
H1

Our approach

Section 1: Calm control in high pressure moments

When an incident happens, speed matters — but so does judgement. We bring structure, experience, and momentum.

We aim to:

Reduce uncertainty

Create an actionable recovery plan

Focus on what makes the biggest difference first

Section 2: Partnership with directors

Our model works in partnership with you and your directors. We support decision-making and help manage competing pressures so you can keep the business moving.

You can expect:

Clear priorities and next actions

Practical support, not “consultancy theatre”

Transparent communication

Section 3: Strategic thinking — even under stress

Loss also brings opportunity, but it’s hard to think strategically in a stressful moment. We help you explore options while staying grounded in what’s realistic.

We’ll help you:

Stabilise operations

Protect revenue and relationships

Explore “blue skies” opportunities where appropriate

ABOUT

About Fourseen

Section 1: Our perspective

Nassim Taleb defines a “Black Swan” as a highly improbable event that is unpredictable, has massive impact, and is explained after the fact as if it were predictable.

In reality, most business losses are not Black Swans — but they still cause disruption, pressure, and financial harm. The difference is how well the response is managed.

Section 2: Our background

Our background is founded in insurance claims, but years ago we recognised clients needed wider practical recovery skills — not only claims handling.

We bring:

Experience in complex recovery situations

Commercial focus on minimising gross profit impact

Practical planning and stakeholder coordination

Section 3: Fees and value

If you don’t have recovery experience, your ability to target your response will be limited. Properly set up, much of the cost of our fees can often be met under insurance (subject to policy terms and circumstances).
